# ISO 37105 - City Anatomy Ontology (CAO)

The ontology provides a machine readable representation of the concepts and properties that underlie the City Anatomy framework. It serves several functions:
"	It elaborates and clarifies the framework by providing a more precise description of the concepts that appear in the framework, enabling a clearer and more complete interpretation of the framework.
"	It provides a data model that cities can use to represent and reason about the anatomy of their city. The data model can be used for planning and operational purposes, and it enhances the interoperability of data amongst city departments.
"	It provides the means of operationalizing framework-based design of cities and communities with the information infrastructure that underlies operations city operations.
